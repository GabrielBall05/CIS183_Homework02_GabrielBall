How to use program: Slide seekbars to change values of red, green, and blue.
		    Click "SAVE COLOR" to save the color you made in a list view.

What the program does: This program allows the user to make and save any color on the rgb spectrum as
well as view the hex representation of the color. When a user saves a color, all its information and
the color itself will be shown in a list. From there, the user can save another color to the list. Upon
clicking on a color in the list, the background, seekbars, rgb and hex values will revert to the
appropriate saved information. The list is scrollable. If a color is too dark, the text will
automatically change to white so the user can read the color's information and vice versa.

Problems I ran into: None
